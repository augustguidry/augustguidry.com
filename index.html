    <p>
    Welcome traveler. Sorry, my blog is taking a nap. I'll get around to fixing it... In due time.

    If you are sitting there thinking, 'Wow, this is unprofessional. One HTML file for the homepage of a technologist? I was hoping for a showcase of 20 MiB of animated JavaScript bloatware,' please feel free to submit your formal complaints to <a href="mailto:august@augustguidry.com">august@augustguidry.com</a>.</p>
    <p>
    Or, you could cry about it to your mom. Your call.
