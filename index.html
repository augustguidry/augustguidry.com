    <h1>August Guidry</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome traveler. Sorry, my blog is taking a nap. I'll get around to fixing it... eventually. Right now, I'm rethinking my life and career choices while doing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage">Shikoku Pilgrimage (四国遍路)</a> in Japan.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are sitting there thinking, 'Wow, this is wildly unprofessional. One single HTML file for the homepage of a professional technologist? I was really hoping for a showcase of 20 MiB of flashy animated JavaScript bloatware,' please feel free to submit your formal complaints to <a href="mailto:august@augustguidry.com">august@augustguidry.com</a>.</p>
    <p>
    Or, you could cry about it to your mom. Your call.
